# DurableCreations: Develop new ways of living for everyone.

## Usage
Clone this repository and `bundle` to install the required gems. Run `rake db:migrate` and then `rake db:seed` to add a few projects and users to the database. Run `shotgun` to preview in your browser.

## Description
This app was built for a Flatiron School project. This is a web app that uses an MVC framework for UI including multiple models, validations for logins & signups, and CRUD functionality.

In this app, a user may upload Human Advancement projects (which include a name, photo, materials, and instructions) to a database with other users. A user can build a new project, or edit or delete an existing project. The user may only edit/delete a project if it belongs to them. The user can view all users' projects, only their own projects, or a single project for editing.

##Contributors Guide
The program is buggy and is welcome by any skilled developer to fix. The basic structure of the webpage should be left alone, but otherwise any css styling or implementation of cleaner code is greatly appreciated. _-/-|-\_ :)
