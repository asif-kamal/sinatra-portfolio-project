## Description
This app was built for a Flatiron School project. This is a web app that uses an MVC framework for UI including multiple models, validations for logins & signups, and CRUD functionality. 

In this app, a user may upload his/her knitting projects (which include a name, photo, materials, and instructions) to a database with other users. A user can build a new project, or edit or delete an existing project. The user may only edit/delete a project if it belongs to them. The user can view all users' projects, only their own projects, or a single project for editing.
